<h1># Story2: Now it's time to work on the specification of which player is about to play his turn. </h1>

We can split this requirement into three tests: <br>

1. The first turn should be played by played X <br>
2. If the last turn was played by X, then the next turn should be played by O <br>
3. If the last turn was played by O, then the next turn should be played by X <br>
